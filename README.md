# Masked or not | ComputerVision
Created ML algorithm that detects whether a person is wearing mask or not using darknet (neural network framework) &amp; yolov3.
The dataset was created by taking images from the internet and using labellimg to convert the boxes into text files. 
Trained the model &amp; got the "last.weights" file using google colab, and ran the code on pycharm.
The algorithm can use webcam, image or input video based on users choice.
